These are the slides and sketches I have prepared for my "Arduino ABC" talk at Soft-Shake'14 in Geneva.

There are actually 2 versions of this presentation:

* the "softshake" version, which matches exactly what I presented during Soft-Shake'14 on 24th October

* the "long version" that would need two 45' slots to present, but is much a much more complete introduction to Arduino

Sketches are all the programs I used on the experiments used in the presentations.

As a bonus, I also provide 2 Excel sheets that I can be useful for the followinf experiments:

* FlexSensorVoltageDivider.xlsx: helps find out the best resistor value to use for the voltage divider set up in the Flex Sensor experiment, so that we get the broader range of values read by `analogRead()`

* ColorLedResistorValues.xlsx: helps find out which resistor values to use for each color component of the RGB LED experiment, based on the forward voltage and luminosity of each LED component
